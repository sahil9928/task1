Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to design and implement an Employee Management System (EMS) for a medium-sized company to streamline employee information management, including personal details, job roles, salary data, and performance tracking.

Objectives:

To develop a user-friendly interface for managing employee data.
To enable easy search and filter functionality for employee records.
To implement secure login and role-based access for different user levels (HR staff, managers, etc.).
Scope:
This system will include features for employee record creation, updates, search, and reporting. The project will not cover payroll processing or integration with third-party HR tools.

Technologies: React, Node.js, PostgreSQL
Budget: $10,000
Expected Outcomes:

A fully functional EMS system that allows HR and managers to view, edit, and manage employee information efficiently.
